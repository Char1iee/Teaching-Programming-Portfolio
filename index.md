### A Programmer

Hello! I'm **Charlie Shang**, a third year CS undergrad stuyding at UCSD. My programming experience includes multiple languages, such as python, Java, C, and C++. I completed my first CS project in a summer camp at Tufts University during high school, which is a game demo built by pygame. This experience made me more determined to major in this field and learn more foundational and advanced knowledge about CS.
